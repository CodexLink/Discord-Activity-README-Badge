A Discord-Based Activity Identifier by a Bot for your Activity Presence Badge on your README. Made on Python.

## The Story

Coming Soon.

## Procedures

Coming Soon.

## Supporting Workflows

As of now, planning before coding is something that I have to normalize. Straight-up coding is not working for me anymore. Do you want to see how this program flows through? Both in the perspective of Bot and a Client? Then check this [drawio file.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ll6P6rstc5iTfRrKagBThs9yJgqGc9Wa/view?usp=sharing)

## Unintended Questions Answered

**Q1. Your procedure to set it up in my repository is quite complex or complicated, why?**

A1. The procedure is expected to be complicated because, Discord's Availability to Open Environment is uncommon for other people to see. What I'm trying to imply is that, you're trying to bring your own presence status somewhere that is not covered in Discord's platform. So I expect things to be quite complicated.

Though, I'm trying my best to see any possible ways to make things quicker and better by automation.

**Q2. Why it adds an SQLite Database File in my Repository?**

A2. You may seem to be confused. But you shouldn't be thinking about it when confirming any conditions that the bot implies. Though, I'm trying to be cheap here as possible. ~~Because I'm still a student, and I have no money throughout this 2020.~~.

In terms of making it to a cloud database, I would have to use Firebase for it, which is a technology that is something I haven't tried. Though, I will be using it for Containerization, the purpose of it was to make the bot alive for any incoming requests.

**Q3. Why are you giving access to People / Why not keep it to yourself?**

A3. Reputation and making use of Open-Source Environment. So far, all of my repositories exists because of my academic projects. What's the point of using open-source when in fact all of my properties were un-~~playable~~. I mean unusable or lacking of equipments to remake or redo the particular fragment/s of the project?

I wanna do something that I want to do and interesting to see, hence this was born. In terms of it, being a submodule to my [Profile README.](https://github.com/CodexLink)

**Q4. Can I change the Actions Filename?**

A4. As of now, it's not possible but it's technically possible. As of October 21, 2020. I'm studying Discord.py and recalling the essentials of Python, which makes me super dumb.
